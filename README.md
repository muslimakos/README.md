# A bit about me
My name is Muslima, I am 18 years old, and I don't have much experience in the field of programming. 
But I believe that this is just the beginning of my journey, and it will get better (even though it might be more challenging). 
Currently, I am studying at Suleyman Demiral University, majoring in Information Technology.

# Hobby
Currently, studying takes up a significant portion of my time,
perhaps that's why I don't have any. But I consider studying to be my hobby. 
It makes me feel better
